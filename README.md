> Do have in mind that the balloons, and control items, only work if there is a player seated on said balloon.
> They will not move, or change speed, if empty.

## Model Update!

As of v0.0.8 and up if you interact with the balloons with dyes in hand, they will be colored

### Available colors are:

| color |               ingame               |     item     |
| :---- | :--------------------------------: | :----------: |
| base  |  ![base](/readme-assets/base.png)  | water bucket |
| red   |   ![red](/readme-assets/red.png)   |   red dye    |
| green | ![green](/readme-assets/green.png) |  green dye   |
| blue  |  ![blue](/readme-assets/blue.png)  |   blue dye   |

> Keep in mind that if you break a balloon, it's color will reset. I still haven't found a way to change this without having an item for every color.

### New Item Model

> NOTES!
> The datapack version file works as both a datapack and resourcepack.
> Put the same file on both folders <br />
> The mod version works globaly just like any other mod
