## Usage

Control the balloon with WASD, Space and Ctrl!

-   W/S increase or decrease the target speed of the balloon
-   A/D rotate the balloon at 5 degrees per tick
-   Space/Ctrl increase or decrease the target vertical speed of the balloon

> Do have in mind that the balloons only work if there is a player seated on them.<br/>They will not move, or change speed, if empty.

> Keep in mind that if you break a balloon, it's color will reset. I still haven't found a way to change this without having an item for every color.

> NOTES!<br/>The datapack version file works as both a datapack and resourcepack.<br/>Put the same file on both folders<br />The mod version works globaly just like any other mod.

> ALERT!<br/>The version 0.2.0-alpha is **not** compatible with the other versions since so many functions got refactored to work with the WASD system, and to improve performance.
