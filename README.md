# Fancy Balloons

A silly datapack that adds a flying balloon controllable by the player

## Recipe

Here is the balloon recipe:<br/>
![recipe](/readme-assets/recipe.png)

## Usage

when you plop down the balloon you will receive 5 items, these items are controllers

-   Balloon Control: when used will toggle between locked rotation or following player
-   Balloon Speed Up/Down: when used will increase/decrease the horizontal speed of the balloon
-   Balloon Ascend/Descend: when used will increase/decrease the vertical speed of the balloon

> Do have in mind that the balloons only work if there is a player seated on them. <br />
> you can only seat on a balloon with empty hands. <br />
> They will not move if empty

## Model Update!

Now if you interact with the balloons with dyes in hand they will be colored

### Available colors are:

| color |               ingame               |     item     |
| :---- | :--------------------------------: | :----------: |
| base  |  ![base](/readme-assets/base.png)  | water bucket |
| red   |   ![red](/readme-assets/red.png)   |   red dye    |
| green | ![green](/readme-assets/green.png) |  green dye   |
| blue  |  ![blue](/readme-assets/blue.png)  |   blue dye   |

> Keep in mind that if you break a balloon the color will reset. I still havent found a way to cnage this without having an item for every color.

### New Item Model

The spawner item for the balloon no longer looks like a bat spawn egg!<br/>
